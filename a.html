      <h2>Let me hold your hands, let us feel the warmth of our love through these hands of ours. Let's look in each other's eyes and see our souls at joy when we're together. Come closer, let me wrap you in my arms, so you can feel safe when you're with me. Let me kiss your cheek, so that I can see your beautiful smile once again.</h2>

      <h2>I don't know how you do it, but you never fail to brighten my day. Even in the darkest of days, you become my star, and shine your light in my life. We could go to the highest mountain to watch the sun set, but my eyes will still be fixed on you. I more than love how gorgeous you are, I believe that I am obsessed with you.</h2>
